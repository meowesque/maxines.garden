This is my digital garden. Here you can find my notes on types, systems, and the beautiful intersections between mathematics and programming. Some entries are quick thoughts, others are deeper dives.

## Philosophy

Learning works best in the open. I write to think, share rough ideas, and refine them over time through iteration and feedback. 

## Feedback
